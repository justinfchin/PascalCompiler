# PascalCompiler
- written in Java
- book used
    - Crafting a Compiler by Fischer Cytron and LeBlanc
## Background
- Compiler.java
    - main program used to compile your Pascal source code
- Scanner.java
    - aka lexical scanner
    - reads source code and groups them into tokesn
        - tokens are identifiers, integers, keywords, and delimeters
    - eliminates unneeded info (like comments)
    - Only Arithmetic and Relational Operators, no Bitwise or Boolean
    - Notes:
        - used HashMap instead of HashTable because did not need thread synchroniziation
        - HashMap also allows for null 
- Parser.java
    - takes the encoded tokens (often as integers) for syntactic analysis
